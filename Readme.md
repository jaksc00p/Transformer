# Transformer

Transformer is a lightweight, stand-alone, Visual Studio 2022 C# Console Application that implements the Transformer architecture, 
used in large language models such as ChatGPT. The implementation follows the paper [Attention Is All You Need](https://arxiv.org/abs/1706.03762). 
The demonstration example is a translation from English to Spanish sentences. 
The project is intended for educational purposes, since the performance is not good enough for larger practical use cases.
There are no third-party dependences; tensor classes, automatic differentiation etc. is implemented from scratch.

## Usage

Edit the settings in Program.cs and compile and run with Visual Studio.
